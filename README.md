# multi-object
the project is used to implement experimental studies for multi-object issues.

we use six state-of-the-art methods (e.g.,  NSGAII, MOCell, SPEA2, PAES, SMSEMOA, RandomSearch) to study the software defect prediction (SDP) issues on two datasets (e.g., PROMISE, ReLink). At the same time, we take four classifier methods (e.g., J48, KNN, LR, NB) into consideration.
The aim of this project is to configure out which one of multi-objective optimization method is most suitable for solving SDP.
